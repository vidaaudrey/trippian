##Trippian Project Track 
We created this file to track the whole project, including important info, notices, daily meeting memos and any other project related materials that we share.

### Important Info and Notice 
- Info 
  - [Project Backlog](https://docs.google.com/a/audreyli.me/spreadsheets/d/1RCjlMw6CdOXqG81kkGs-ssQaS_IszVXLI0p_6t_q6OE/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Project Scopes for commit messages: 
    
    when in doubt, add the file name or the feature, or consult with team. A few scopes to choose: 
    - UI: static mockups, style changes, html changes 
    - **Server**: any server side changes (can be more specic, such as DB, ServerRoutes, testing...)
    - **Client**: any client side changes (can be more specific, such as ClientRoutes, testing... )
    - **package.json**: if you are not sure, just put the name here, so it's clear 
    - **Client(routes.js)**: as routes can be at server and client, it's good to prefix with the scope here 
    - **Server(app.spec.js)**:...

  - Quick Ref on commiting messages:
    - feat: A new feature
    - fix: A bug fix
    - docs: Documentation only changes
    - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - perf: A code change that improves performance
    - test: Adding missing tests
    - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
